# Getting Started with Algorithm

Some good problems' description are in Chinese. If you can not get the idea, ask LLM for translation.  

## Skills

### Binary Search

### Dynamic Programming

### Overloading Operators

## Sorting algorithm

### Merge sort

### Min/Max Heap (priority queue)

## String algorithm

### kmp

### extended kmp (Z function)

### manacher

### tire tree

### AC automation

## Graph algorithm

### DFS and BFS

## Data Structure

### Segment Tree

*Very useful and powerful.*
[Q1](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/242/E)
[Q2](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/240/F)
[Q3 (a little difficult)](https://www.spoj.com/problems/GSS2/)

### Balance Tree (Splay, Scapegoat Tree)

*It is very very very flexible.*


### Persistent Data Structure

*It tests your understanding of segment tree.*
[Q0: kth smallest value in an interval](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P3834) (online algorithmn only, *the problem discription is in Chinese)
[Q1](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/242/E)
[Q2: find the mex(smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in a set) of an interval ](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P4137)(online algorithmn, *the problem discription is in Chinese)
[Q3](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1422/F)

### Blocking

*It can be anything.*
[Q1](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/920/F) (also can be done by using segment tree)
[Q2(Mo's algorithm)](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/617/E)

## Something about Math

### Prime Number (Euler's Sieve)

### Inverse Elements (linearly get all the inverse)

### Game Theory (Nim Game)

*The following problems are only about basic/altered Nim Game*
[Q0](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P2197) (*the problem discription is in Chinese)
[Q1](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P1247) (*the problem discription is in Chinese)
[Q2 (K-Nim, a little difficult)](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P2490) (*the problem discription is in Chinese)
[Q3 (Anti-Nim)](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P4279) (*the problem discription is in Chinese)
[Q4 (altered Nim Game)](https://www.luogu.com.cn/problem/P3480) (*the problem discription is in Chinese)
